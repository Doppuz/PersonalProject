## About The Project

Personal project developed in Unreal Engine 5. It's a Co-op arena rogue-style game where the goal is to survive as long as possible by earning as many points as you can.

## Coding practice
Every aspect of the game is implemented from scratch always taking into consideration the respect of the Networking principles and replication. I am trying to make the game as much modular as possible.

# Key elements
The game features a few key elements that are currently implemented:
- Co-op functionality.
- Manager that controls the score, spawners, and rules of the game.
- Range Enemies that shoot at the closest player
- Melee Enemies that attack the closest player.
- Dash ability for the player
- Shield power-up for the player
- Health and Score UI
