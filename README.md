## About The Project

Personal project currently in development in Unreal Engine 5. It's a Co-op arena rogue-style game where the goal is to survive as long as possible by earning as many points as you can.

## Coding practice
Every aspect of the game is implemented from scratch always taking into consideration the respect of the Networking principles and replication. I am trying to make the game as much modular as possible.

# Key elements
- Action Component: Keep all the actions that a particular actor can execute.
- Stat Manager: keep all the attributes of the actor.
